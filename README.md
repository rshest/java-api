# Split Java SDK

This SDK is designed to work with [Split](https://www.split.io), the platform for controlled rollouts. This SDK interacts with the application API for identifying traffic. If you are looking for the Split rollout SDK, it can be found on [Github](https://github.com/splitio/api-java) or through its [documentation](http://docs.split.io/docs/java-sdk-guide).

### Quick setup

For specific instructions on how to set up the Java API SDK refer to our [Detailed-README](Detailed-README.md) or our [official SDK documentation](http://docs.split.io/docs/sdk-overview).

### Commitment to Quality:

Split’s SDKs are in active development and are constantly tested for quality. Unit tests are developed for each SDK based on the unique needs of that language, and integration tests, load and performance tests, and behavior consistency tests are running 24/7 via automated bots. In addition, monitoring instrumentation ensures that these SDKs behave under the expected parameters of memory, CPU, and I/O.

### About Split:

Split builds on feature flags to create the platform for controlled rollouts, so any team can target customers and release or revert new features without a deployment—or touching code. Get started quickly with SDKs in your language, then create on/off, percentage, and multivariate rollout plans in seconds. Integrations with the services you use to monitor, alert and track issues reduce time-to-resolution when things go wrong, and hotfixes are entirely avoided by killing problem features with a single click.

 * What you can do with Split. Split goes beyond the simple on/off capabilities of basic feature flagging to give your team the power to:

 	* Create multivariate feature releases
	* Create A/B feature releases
	* Kill any feature, over the browser, with a single click
	* Target releases to subsets of your audience, including percentage roll outs, whitelists,    attribute-based targeting, and individual user IDs 
	* Integrate with the services your team uses to monitor, plan and communicate, like Datadog, JIRA and Slack 
	* Manage team access, with features like two-factor authentication and role-based permissioning.
